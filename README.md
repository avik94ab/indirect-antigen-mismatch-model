# indirect-antigen-mismatch-model

This package is a wrapper function for NetMHCIIPan4.0 that considers just donor HLA Class I derived peptides being presented by recipient HLA Class II molecule.

## Pre-requisite Python packages

All code was developed in Python 3.x, and you will need a Python notebook viewer (such as Jupyter), the SciPy and NumPy libraries (which should be standard), the Pandas library, the iedbtools to make full use of the notebooks. You can install the latter two as pip packages "pandas" and "iedb".
